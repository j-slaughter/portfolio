# Personal Website

This will be my own custom website that I am building out. It will display a portfolio of my coding projects,
and be a digital resume. The idea behind this is to play around with UX/UI design concepts within a production-level fullstack application, and most importantly, HAVE FUN!

# Tech Stack

This is the toolkit I plan on utilizing to build out the project:

 - Node.js/ Express
 - React
 - Webpack
 - Jest
 - (Even though it is an individual project, I plan on containerizing with Docker cause that little whale logo is just so cute... and I might be switching between OS machines during dev.)

## Forget Social Media, if you don't have your own custom website....do you even code, bro?
